# Day 31

- Infrastructure Planning is crucial, its the first thing we do for a project
  - diagrams, architecture
  - have a plan notes for steps, have a big picture of the infra
- Practice drawing/ visualising the construction of VPC and its components
  - in a logical flow order (not strict)
    <br/><br/>
- Now, we will start building expense-project
- Each component module is generally stored in separate repository
  <br/><br/>
- Security Groups control the traffic - both inbound and outbound
- Instances are dependent on Security Group, so we should create Security Groups first
- For security groups, there is name & security group name
  - security group name is fixed and must be unique
  - security group name is referred as an argument called 'name' in tf files
  - name comes from tags, so no restrictions as such
    <br/><br/>
- Using IP Address to filter out traffic using Security Group involves
  - Deleting IPs of instances that are terminated
  - Adding IPs of instances that are just created
  - Reading IPs to check for duplicacy
  - Constant monitoring of instances for the sake of security
- So filtering an instance that has a specific security group is easier and efficient
  <br/><br/>
- Making values available to user through output is the reponsibility of Module Developer
- Storing and Retrieving Parameter Store data is the responsibility of Module User
  - Module Dev (output.tf, data) => User (parameters.tf, {name: data}) => SSM Store
  - User (datasources.tf, {name: data}) <= SSM Store
- General Rule: Store all possible IDs of the resources in SSM (except sensitive ones)
  <br/><br/>
- Using SSM is analogous to using a Family Bank Account
- Use SSM Parameter Store for bringing VPC ID from SSM Store
  - User module of VPC should put in the Parameter Store first
  - Format: `/project_name/environment/parameter_name` 
	  - MUST start with `/`
	<br/><br/>
- Use dynamic block for egress to accept multiple rules
- Create Security Groups for all the instances, include public traffic
  <br/><br/>
- Stateful
  - when an application/ instance requires user data to be persistent
  - requires maintainance, regular backups and testing, upgrades without much downtime, scaling and replication, load balancing (Tasks of DB Admin Teams)
  - Examples: Database (AWS RDS is a managed service, more stable solution)
- Stateless
  - when an application/ instance is independent of user data
  - easy to restore
  - Examples: Backend, Frontend, etc
    <br/><br/>
- Naming used (Not strict)
  - `PROJECT_NAME-ENVIRONMENT-NAME-COMPONENT-SUBNET_TYPE-SUBNET_REGION`
